# Freelance Illusrater | Artist | Blogger 

Hello, my name is Jesse Soto A.K.A The Sketch. I've created a Youtube channel called The Sketch where I upload raw, unedited footage of me finding my way to a masterpiece. I'm a creator/illustrator/artist/blogger up for hire. 

Here are some of my most recent works using Tayausi Sketches software on a simple setup consisting of a MacBook and mouse.

## No….! 

## It’s just good ole capitalism!



## Well, maybe. But its also Newtons third law of thermal dynamics:

## Every action has an equal of opposite reaction.


If we were to suffer a catastrophic event such as a nuclear winter and should these two structures remain intact similar to the bank of Japan over which the atom bomb was dropped. And should a civilization many years in the future extra or ordinary should come across it, these two structures beside one another would say it all. Or better yet, lets laser inscribe it into a golden plate and on the other side have the coordinates of our in habitants along with the binary layout of our genome and blast into outerspace and sit back and wait for a response.

Indeed this photo should be archived in the Smithsonian vault as the pinnacle of American Society. The image is far from satire but indicative of an age where the line sometimes seemed to blur or to be non-existent altogether. Or perhaps in the future our history modules (because textbooks would become obsolete at this point) would recall this image as the Age of Mental Health Crisis in America. Editors cut: When trying to gauge the meaning of this image other comparisons cropped up, such as a funeral home next to a senior living center or dispensary next to an All You Can Eat Buffet. I couldn’t quite wrap my head around it. Then a more sinister comparison came to mind perhaps just an allegory to this age in the West where mental health issues have been on a steady ascent: an image of an ammo store next to a school. 

Such events as school shootings are also indicative of a social structure under fire, no pun at all. These are human beings we’re talking about. To have such an opportunity of being human is ineffable. If you are hot already, I would like to set your mind at ease by letting you know ahead of time there is a solution you’re reading towards. 

You see after all instant gratification has become the norm. Sensory ingestion overload seems to be the highest form of superior greatness that is to be the highest bar of the human realm to be experienced. To capitalize on our sense organs whether it be through our trivial interactions of idle jargon or sensual experiences, we have put experiences at the top of the pedestal and we have become its slave. In reality this just leaves us with an empty void riddled with confusion and disarray. Sometimes it leaves us with mental and self-inflicted pain along with the feeling of emptiness. Thus, not knowing the root cause we turn to substance abuse to quote-unquote remedy the problem. There’s little wonder as to why the opioid problem has reached epidemic proportions and suicide rates have been on the uprise as of late. 

At this point you may be asking: Where does it all stem from? Asking this leads us only one step away from a viable solution.

One proposition for a solution is not a quick one, not by a long shot, but rather one that may very well nip-it-in-the-bud, that is, across the board education on emotional resilience.

Ancient Indian knowledge on emotional resiliance is the oldest uncovered body of knowledge that may hold the key to our current and futures civility. We start in the very beginning, in academia. The amount of resources and emphasis we put in teaching emotional awareness to grade school children could heed profound results regarding how they begin to learn about their emotions and how to deal with them appropriately. Western society is just beginning to take interest in these ancient practices through undertaking yoga, courses in mindfulness training, meditation. In fact, the U.S. military has begun to take notice on the many benefits this age ole knowledge has to offer.   

In order to bring this into the social arena we would all have to want it and to work together towards making it reality. These techniques would infuse every facet of society and once it becomes common knowledge only then will it truly take shape. I’m no social engineer, just a concerned citizen working towards a brighter future for all beings. Therefore the following would be some suggestions. Begin with our public school systems, promoting the importance of emotional awareness and emplementing them through state run programs such as civic center community outreach. Up to our elected officials haven taken courses as a prerequisite. This would only be the beginning, there should be an emphasis on mental health issues and its solutions through media outlets public and private as of now. This is the only national emergency I’m aware of, the mental health crisis currently not talked about.  After all we all play our individual roles but at a collective cost. The cost of not understanding one another by having a faulty emotional reaction rather than a healthy emotional response.   


For other countries looking towards the West as one would their idol; My only heed you caution in your resolution to become more westernized, although we are the land of the free, as a social whole and member of the global frontier may our faults come to light sooner than our will to out pace them with ignorance.  
  

It’s nothing new America is the foremost powerhouse and the face of globalization. As we are in the age of materialism, America has become a brand all on its own aside from the very parts that make it up.
